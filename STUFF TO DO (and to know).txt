####### CCP      Cumulative Choke Potential

It's used to define Censoring ASes: we define the set of censors C as a subset of S, 
which have the highest potential of choking outflow paths that go from S to D

S rappresent the AS in the country, D rappresent the AS ourside the country

A border AS is an AS in S, with at least one direct
link to an AS outside of S. Set B is the set of all border ASes.

 consider a subset of border ASes, B′ ⊂ B.
Their Cumulative Choke Potential (CPP) is the fraction of
outflow paths that they could choke together.

####### CRP      Censorship Resilience Potential.

Censorship Resilience Potential (CRP) is a metric that measures a network's ability to maintain connectivity by avoiding nodes 
that may censor or block traffic. 

It determines how much of the traffic can bypass predefined censoring nodes, 
ensuring resilient communication paths. 

CRP can be calculated using known censoring nodes or by identifying them through their Cumulative Choke Potential (CCP). 

It's the percentage of paths inside the country still present after removing the AS with the highest CCP

               using as choking ASes the [0,1,2 ...,10] Border AS of that country that have the highest CCP
               and see with a line for each country the percentage of paths that get choked


####### GRP      Global Reachability Potential.

value of CRP is obtained using Cumulative Choke Potential (CCP). 
In this case, the underlying assumption is that censoring ASes would be border ASes of the country.

 Thus, the value of the metric could directly
be determined by calculating the portion of paths that start in
the country and end up outside the country, not passing through censoring ASes.

FIX: we are considering too many paths, a free peering link can not be used in any path generated from any point in the world
    because that's a link that only the owner of the free peering link (and its clients) can use.
    First generate a graph removing ALL the peering link to calculate the shortest path and than add them again an 
    consider only paths allowed in those link (paths between the owners or their clients)

               showing how the GRP and CRP changes over the years. (for example showing the Reachability after 5 biggest CP AS removed)


>>>>>>>  GRAPH maybe only for italy show the rise and fall through the years of the ASes with the biggest Choking Potential
                (showing lines that rise and fall based on the value of the Choking Potential)
