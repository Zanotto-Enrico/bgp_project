####### CCP      Cumulative Choke Potential

It's used to define Censoring ASes: we define the set of censors C as a subset of S, 
which have the highest potential of choking outflow paths that go from S to D

S rappresent the AS in the country, D rappresent the AS ourside the country

A border AS is an AS in S, with at least one direct
link to an AS outside of S. Set B is the set of all border ASes.

 consider a subset of border ASes, B′ ⊂ B.
Their Cumulative Choke Potential (CPP) is the fraction of
outflow paths that they could choke together.

####### CRP      Censorship Resilience Potential.

value of CRP is obtained using Cumulative Choke Potential (CCP). 
In this case, the underlying assumption is that censoring ASes would be border ASes of the country.

 Thus, the value of the metric could directly
be determined by calculating the portion of paths that start in
the country and end up outside the country, not passing through censoring ASes.
